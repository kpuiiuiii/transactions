## Introduction
- This is the capstone project of the Ruby on Rails curriculum. This  project is completed as part of the Open Avenues Foundation provided to work on by Teena Mathew and Elena Semeyko.

- In this project I created an expense app where users can create an account with their email address and add expenses which can be viewed in a list associated to the corresponding account created.

- Users can track the total amount of their expenses.

- This project is built with the MVC approach.
